These are my personal, partial solutions to the applied exercises in Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent new textbook on applied statistical/machine learning with python. The solutions are partial as 1. Some questions are inherently open ended. 
2. Some questions are simply applied proofs of theorems in the book which I didn't feel were worth posting.
3. I simply didn't find them worthwhile for whatever reason (repetitiveness of some questions, trivial questions, etc). 
I have tried to stay faithful to the techniques and methods taught by the labs, but have made changes in various sections, most notably in the deep learning section due to dependency issues in the current version.
The book is still very new - still in its first printing - so there were bound to be some bugs here and there (ex: the BART model simply doesn't work on windows!) These can be tracked comprehensively on the forums of the book's website, statlearning.com.
I am sure as time goes on there will be more complete and elegant solutions published, but I'd like to imagine that someone out there will get value out of mine.
